Please use this updated table as a comprehensive guide for the project requirements. Ensure each task is completed and checked off before submitting your project for assessment.
Note there is a high-level (less detailed) checklist in the project journal, which is also used for grading. 
While there are a lot of items here, most items are small and can be addressed with 1-3 lines of code.
